                            <p>A highly motivated and hardworking individual, undertaking a programming course who is seeking
                                a learning- based role in an IT Company. My education, self-taught knowledge and experience combined
                                with my interest and passion in Cloud Computing and Virtualisation, Servers, and Coding will allow
                                me to learn, contribute and excel in the Information & Technology Industry. Building computers and
                                providing general IT support and troubleshooting has given me a technical understanding of computer
                                components, hardware, software, and network configuration.
                            </p>

                        <p> I have a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering but unfortunatly have been unable to obtain
                            full-time employment with the skills that I have acquired during my university studies. I have
                            decided to undertake a career change in coding and hopefully develop skills that will enable me
                            to secure employment that will allow me to provide for my family. I hope to develop a strong
                            foundation in coding with this course.
